# Eventlight

### Eventlight 

[Eventlight] is a clone of [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/). Eventlight allows users create, bookmark, and register for events. Events are categorized by type and location.

## Background and Overview

Eventlight is designed to match the basic functionality of Eventbrite and demonstrate the effcient use of the MERN stack.

We will need to: 
  * Create a schema and build a MongoDB database to store application data 
  * Establish a backend API
  * Establish frontend routes
  * Create a React frontend for UI
